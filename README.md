# weather-dashboard

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-This application allows users to search for weather data for a specific city. The user can then save or delete that data.
-The motivation to create this project was to learn how to better understand and implement APIs.
- I learned a lot of how to access data from other sources and implement it in way that can be user friendly. Even though this project is not perfect, I now know a lot more than when I started.
